# Generate Summary Statistics & Summarize Categorical Data
 This project analyzes and presents a statistical summary of a sales dataset, focusing on the 'Sales' column for numerical metrics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, skewness, and quartiles, and visualizes them through histograms and boxplots. The project summarizes categorical data by creating a frequency table, a crosstab between 'Category' and 'Region', and visualizes category proportions using pie charts and bar charts. The project also demonstrates various techniques for transforming categorical data into numerical formats, including value replacement, label encoding, one-hot encoding, binary encoding, and backward difference encoding, to prepare the data for further analysis or machine learning modeling.

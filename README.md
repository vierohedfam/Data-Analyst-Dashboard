# Generate Summary Statistics & Summarize Categorical Data
 This project analyzes and presents a statistical summary of a sales dataset, focusing on the 'Sales' column for numerical metrics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, skewness, and quartiles, and visualizes them through histograms and boxplots. The project summarizes categorical data by creating a frequency table, a crosstab between 'Category' and 'Region', and visualizes category proportions using pie charts and bar charts. The project also demonstrates various techniques for transforming categorical data into numerical formats, including value replacement, label encoding, one-hot encoding, binary encoding, and backward difference encoding, to prepare the data for further analysis or machine learning modeling.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/vierohedfam/Data-Analyst-Dashboard/blob/main/Sample%20-%20Superstore_table.xlsx"> Superstore Data</a>

## Questions
- How is the sales data distributed based on standard deviation and variance?
- What is the frequency of sales across various value ranges? Is there a sales value range that occurs most frequently?
- Which product categories are the most sold in each region?
- How many items are in each product category? Which category has the largest number of items?

## Process
- Generate descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, skewness, and quartiles for the 'Sales' column.
- Visualize sales distribution using histograms and boxplots to identify patterns and outliers.
- Create a contingency table (crosstab) to show the relationship between 'Category' and 'Region'.
- Calculate the frequency of occurrence of each 'Category' and display it in a frequency table.
- Convert the 'Category' column data type to categorical for efficiency.
- Demonstrate various encoding techniques for converting categorical data into numeric format.
